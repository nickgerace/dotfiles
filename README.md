[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/nickgerace/dotfiles?style=flat-square)](./LICENSE)

A collection of [@nickgerace](https://github.com/nickgerace)'s dotfiles and miscellaneous scripts.

## Shell Configuration

These dotfiles have been tested in the following environments using `zsh` as the default shell:

OS | amd64 | arm64 (aarch64)
--- | --- | ---
macOS | âœ… | âœ…
Linux (GNU) | âœ… | ðŸš«
WSL2 Linux (GNU) | âœ… | ðŸš«

Execute `make` to get started.

> _Note: the shell configuration does not use `oh-my-zsh`._
> _Only `zsh` needs to be installed as everything is configured manually._

## Disclaimer

Scripts not recently in use may be out of date.
This is a "living" repository, meaning that scripts and dotfiles more frequently in use will be more likely to be kept up to date.
Anything not recently or frequently in use will be removed from the repository (eventually).
