# Neovim

This directory contains `neovim` config files.
The theme (`one.vim`) is cached from upstream here for a few reasons...

1. It is very rarely updated.
2. Reduce wasteful bandwidth by not downloading the file constantly.

For the theme, all credit goes to the contributors: [https://github.com/rakr/vim-one](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one)
